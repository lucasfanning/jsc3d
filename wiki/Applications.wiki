== Online Ring Customization ==

_*Princeton Ring*_ provides an online ring design interface where a client can fully customize and preview a new ring. After an order placement, the result is generated immediately using 3D printing, then polished and delivered. _JSC3D_ is integrated into the online design system for preview of a ring.

== Hygiene Products Display ==

_*Berendsen Textil Service A/S*_ uses _JSC3D_ for online display of their hygienic solutions. The virtual environment of a washroom is built up based on pictures and videos as well as a series of hot spots that navigate to the hygiene facilities. On the close view of each facility, there is a hot spot linking to a 3D view of this product, where its detailed and customizable model will be displayed.

== Interactive View of Facial Sculptures ==

_*IvarFace Technology*_ fused the cutting-edge 3D scanning and 3D printing technology and brings them to sculpture art. They provide statue production service for one who would like his/her face to be shaped on sculpture that looks like ancient Greek or Roman style. Face data is captured by fast 3D scanning. Then after some post processing, a high quality facial sculpture is printed out using inexpensive 3D printing technique. _JSC3D_ is adopted to provide interactive preview of face models generated from 3D scanning.

== Review of User Submitted Models before 3D Printing ==

_*3D Printing @ Columbia*_ is a research project that allows people to upload interesting models (in STL format) to be 3D printed freely. When a model is submitted, it will be displayed using _JSC3D_ in a review page to take snapshots. The model will then be added into the gallery where visitors can view all submitted stuff and vote for their favorite masterpieces. The most up-voted models will be put to printing with a _MakerBot Replicator 2_ 3D printer.

== Online Interactive Crystal Models ==

_*Smorf Crystals*_ puts effort to collect and arrange information of crystal minerals and put them online in a way easy to view and search. They also provide 3D printing service of crystal models for researchers. _JSC3D_ is adopted there for presenting structures of various crystals.

== CAD Modeling Tool Online ==

_*OpenJSCAD-soprano*_ is an experimental branch of the _OpenJSCAD_ project, which aims to provide a distinctive CAD tool for modellers to generate solid 3D models online. Unlike other modeling softwares, most of which are designed for artists, _OpenJSCAD_ is focusing on an industrial aspect: it accepts a snippet of script and generates 3D models from it using constructive solid geometry (CSG) method. Existing models from files (STL, AMF, etc.) are also acceptable. With _JSC3D_, the tool runs smoothly on most browsers with or without WebGL.

== Delivery of 3D content in E-Learning System ==

The _*Learning and Teaching Centre (LTC)*_ and the _*Department of Ancient History*_ of _*Macquarie University*_ creates a project to develop a fully online course for students of Egyptology through the use of 3D scanned artefacts. The _LTC_ has a skilled team to capture high definition scans of ancient artefacts and prepare them for inclusion in their _iLearn_ system. _JSC3D_ as a key component is used to establish a web based interface that works across browsers and mobile devices for delivery of 3D content. These provide a highly authentic learning experience. A workflow has been summarized along the development of the project and is considered to be furtherly reused in more online course design.
