== Review of User Submitted Models before 3D Printing ==

_*3D Printing @ Columbia*_ is a research project that allows people to upload interesting models (in STL format) to be 3D printed freely. When a model is submitted, it will be displayed using _JSC3D_ in a review page to take snapshots. The model will then be added into the gallery where visitors can view all submitted stuff and vote for their favorite masterpieces. The most up-voted models will be put to printing with a _MakerBot Replicator 2_ 3D printer.
